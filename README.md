## 👋 Your first hello to the city

A city is always around us,  
yet we often don’t really know it.  
Arriving somewhere new, the simple question of  
*“Where should I go?”*  
can feel overwhelming.

**hei-local is here to guide that very first step.**  
Let the city introduce itself through one short video at a time.

## 🌍 Why we built hei-local  
### Most of us don’t truly know the neighborhood we live in.

When we first arrived in Helsinki,  
finding authentic local places was surprisingly difficult.

- A few photos  
- A handful of reviews  
- Mostly text-based information  

None of it captured the **vibe**—  
what it *feels* like to be in that place.

Yet Wolt understands cities better than anyone.  
Local shops, people's preferences, the rhythm of the streets.

To help more people feel that connection quickly,  
we created **hei-local**.

## 🎥 What hei-local does  
### The fastest way to fall in love with the local  
### Auto-generated Local Shorts

hei-local’s AI analyzes  
Google Maps photos and reviews  
and transforms them into **8-second auto-generated shorts**.

Each short captures:

- The atmosphere of the place  
- Why locals love it  
- How far it is from you  
- A one-line reason to visit  

With one swipe,  
**your next favorite spot appears right in front of you.**

## ⚙️ How it works

### 1) Analyze place data  
We pull photos and review text from Google Maps and let AI interpret them.

### 2) Create the local story  
AI summarizes why the place is loved and what makes it special.

### 3) Auto-generate the short  
Photo sequencing → text → transitions → mood → 8-second short.

### 4) Explore on the map  
Swipe through vibes, tap to see location, and start walking.
